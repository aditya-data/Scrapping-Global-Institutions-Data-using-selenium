This repository contains data scraped from institutions in 250+ countries. The data includes information about the institutions' names, URLs, and locations. The data was collected from a website with pre-HTML5 structure, and Selenium webbrowser and BeautiFul Soup was used as the web scraping tool.

## Project Highlights

- Utilized Selenium to extract data from 'https://www.whed.net/results_institutions.php' with a pre HTML5 structure.
- Overcame various challenges through extensive research and troubleshooting.
- The scraped data can be used for research, analysis, or other applications related to global institutions.
